### Virus Contig Annotation Pipeline

`vcat` annotates viral contigs by sequentially comparing query sequences against nucleotide, protein, and profile databases using `mmseqs2`. The annotation process includes three stages.

#### Nucleotide database comparison

Query sequences are first compared to the nucleotide database using mmseqs_blastn. Optionally, users can switch to mmseqs_tblastx for higher sensitivity at the cost of longer run-times. vcat then tries to find the genome with the highest nucleotide similarity to the query seqeunce by approximating the ANIs between the query and genomes in the database. If the total ANI between the query and the targert is greater than 0.81, we assign the query to target's species. Target's genus is trnsfered to the query, if the ANI between them is between 0.49 and 0.81.


Here, **total ANI (tANI)** is defined as follows.

Let:

- $ Q $ be an unknown virus contig that needs to be taxonomically annotated.  
- $ Nuc_{db} $ be a database of known virus genomes (here: ICTV genomes).  
- We search $ Q $ against $ Nuc_{db} $ to retrieve all matches for $ Q $ in $ Nuc_{db} $.  
- Let $ M_{db} $ be the list of genomic regions in $ TN_{db} $ that $ Q $ maps to.  
- $ M_n \subseteq M_{db} $ represents all regions similar to a target genome $T_n$ with taxonomic assignment $ n $.

We calculate the total length of alignments to each taxonomic rank and the similarity of these alignments to $ C $ using:

$$
\text{tANI} =
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{M_n} \text{talnlen}_i \times \text{fidentity}_i}
     {\sum_{i=1}^{M_n} \text{talnlen}_i}
$$

where

$$
\text{talnlen}_i = \text{length of alignment } i \text{ between } Q \text{ and } T_{n}
$$

$$
\text{tfident}_i = \text{identity of alignment } i \text{ between } Q \text{ and } T_{n}
$$

#### Protein database comparison

For query sequences without significant nucleotide-level matches, open reading frames (ORFs) are predicted along the contig, and the resulting amino acid sequences are compared against the viral protein database. Based on these matches, we calculate the taxonomic average amino acid identity (taxo AAI) between the query contig and each candidate taxon, and assign the query to the taxon with the highest taxo AAI.

This taxo AAI is conceptually different from a “total AAI” between two genomes or sequences, where AAI is computed directly between a single query genome and a single target genome by averaging the identities of their shared orthologs. In contrast, taxo AAI aggregates information across all matched proteins belonging to a taxonomic group (e.g. genus or family), potentially originating from multiple genomes within that group. As a result, taxo AAI reflects the overall similarity of the query contig to an entire taxon, rather than to any single reference genome, and is therefore better suited for taxonomic assignment in the presence of incomplete, fragmented, or diverse reference data.

Here, **taxonomic AAI (txAAI)** is defined as follows.

Extending the definitions above:

- Let $ P_Q $ be the set of genes (ORFs) on $ Q $.  
- Let $ Prot_{db} $ be a database of viral proteins from ICTV genomes.  
- $ Prot_{db} $ is searched for matches to the ORFs found in $ Q $.  
- Let $ P_m \subseteq P_Q $ represent the subset of ORFs from $ Q $ that have significant matches in $ P_{db} $ to taxon $n$.  
- $ I_{m_i} $ is the amino acid identity between the $ i $-th matched ORF in $ P_m $ and its corresponding hit in $ P_{db} $.

Then the taxonomic average amino acid identity is:

$$
\text{taxo AAI} =
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} I_{m_i}
$$

where

$$
n = |P_m| \text{, the number of ORFs with matches}
$$

$$
I_{m_i} = \text{amino acid identity of matched ORF } i \text{ between } C \text{ and } P_{db}
$$

#### Profile database comparison

Sequences that remain unannotated at the protein level are compared to a protein profile (HMM) database to provide taxonomic annotations.

Here, **taxonomic API (txAPI)** is calculated similarly to taxo AAI, except the target database is a protein profile (HMM) database instead of a protein sequence database.

Let:

- $ H_{db} $ be the profile HMM database derived from ICTV viral protein families.  
- $ H_m $ represent the subset of ORFs from $ C $ that match profiles in $H_{db}$.  
- $ S_{m_i} $ be the percent sequence identity (or bit-score-normalized identity, depending on implementation) between the $i $-th ORF and its matched profile.

Then:

$$
\text{taxo API} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} S_{m_i}
$$

where

$$
n = |H_m| \text{, the number of ORFs with profile matches}
$$

$$
S_{m_i} = \text{similarity score between ORF } i \text{ in } C \text{ and its matched profile in } H_{db}
$$

#### Database Generation Pipeline


The vcat database generation pipeline automates the creation of comprehensive viral nucleotide, protein, and profile databases. The process includes the following steps:

**1. ICTV metadata parsing and genome download**

vcat parses the ICTV Metadata Resource and downloads all viral genomes and proteins from NCBI GenBank.

**2. Custom taxonomy creation**

A custom `taxdump` for the ICTV taxonomy is generated using **taxonkit**.

**3. Nucleotide and protein database construction**

Custom nucleotide and protein databases are created using **mmseqs2**, incorporating the ICTV-specific taxdump.

**4. Protein clustering and profile database creation**

Viral proteins are clustered, and these clusters are converted into a protein profile (HMM) database.
